## About
WEBSTAR is a Bayesian power ranking system for NCAA Division I men's college basketball. It estimates each team's adjusted offensive efficiency and adjusted defensive efficiency in real time, then combines them into an overall rating used to rank all 365+ D1 programs.
The model is updated continuously throughout the season at 3AM everyday to ensure the conclusion of all games, giving you a current snapshot of team strength rather than a static end-of-season summary.
